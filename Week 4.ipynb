Australia, where the city is situated, is not well known for nightlife. Finding the right spot to entertain at night in Sydney can be difficult and frustrating. \n\nThus, the problem I want to solve is to give a simple recommendation to tourists in Sydney: in which district of the city will you find the highest number of bars, pubs or lounges? The **target audience** are foreign tourists looking for an area in which to enjoy their nightlife."

I will use the areas and the data about nightlife in these areas from foursquare to show the density of entertaining place in them. "
